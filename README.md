AI-Powered Medical Imaging & Electrophysiological Signal Chatbot
Overview
This project is an AI-powered interactive chatbot designed for analyzing medical imaging data (MRI, CT, PET, X-ray) and electrophysiological signals (EEG, ECG, EMG). It supports multiple file formats including images (JPG, PNG, JPEG), PDFs, and signal data files (CSV, Excel). The chatbot allows users to upload files and interactively request analyses such as intensity histogram evaluation, waveform plotting, and AI-based abnormality detection.

Features
Upload and process medical images and electrophysiological signals

Intensity histogram and affected region analysis on medical images

Waveform visualization and statistical analysis for electrophysiological signals

AI models trained on intensity histograms and signal statistics for abnormality prediction

Chatbot interface for interactive, user-friendly data analysis

Supports common file formats: JPG, PNG, JPEG, PDF, CSV, XLS, XLSX
